# Technologies and Tools Used:

* JavaScript
* SASS
* CSS3
* HTML5
* jQuery library
* AJAX
* APIs
* GULP

# Summary and Personal Learning
This site allows the user to choose from six news categories and then displays up to 12 relevant and recent news stories directly from the New York Times.

The data requirements from the project concepts allowed me to investigate the process for obtaining an API key and to set up the connection to the data server using AJAX and JQuery. GULP was used to add developer functionality for task automation.
